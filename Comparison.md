Streamlit vs. Voila 
Streamlit is a complete data dashboarding solution, while Voila is a simpler and more limited tool that lets you convert existing Jupyter Notebooks into basic data dashboards and serve them as web applications to non-technical users.

Like Streamlit, Voila is built on top of the Tornado web framework, so you can use Jupyter notebooks along with Voila to get something broadly similar to Streamlit. But Streamlit is more flexible (it doesn’t require you to use Jupyter), while Voila can be simpler (provided you already have Jupyter Notebooks you want to present).

Voila uses Jupyter’s widget library, while Streamlit uses custom widgets – so if you’re already familiar with Jupyter, you’ll find Voila easier to work with.

Use Streamlit If you’re looking for an all-in-one solution.
Use Voila if you already have Jupyter Notebooks and are looking for a way to serve them.
